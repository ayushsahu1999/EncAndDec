# EncAndDec
A fun repo for encrypting and decrypting the Python Strings.

# Why I made this?
I made this Python Program because I didn't had anything to do so I started making it. And also just for fun:)

# What it does?

## Encrypting:
It takes input as a String like 'BABA' or 'badkf' and it gives output as '(16)(06)(16)(06)'.

## Decrypting
It takes input as a String like '(16)(06)(16)(06)' and it gives output as 'BABA' or 'badkf'.

## How does it Encrypt?

## Step 1:
It takes String as input.

## Step 2:
It converts each character of String into its equivalent ASCII code.

## Step 3:
It then converts each ASCII code into their binary form of 8 bits.

## Step 4:
It then counts number of ones in each binary number.

## Step 5:
It then wraps number of ones for each character in parenthesis.

## Step 6:
The Encrypting is done.
